New Variable trainingFlag in Suborder -> when creating a new suborder, can set this to true to set the training-flag on as a default for every booking on that suborder.

Change of database scheme:

ALTER TABLE SUBORDER ADD TRAININGFLAG BOOLEAN;
Update SUBORDER SET TRAININGFLAG = False;


Changes in tb:

org.tb.bdom.Suborder.java:
	added a new variable Boolean trainingFlag with getter and setter.
	
org.tb.bdom.SuborderViewDecorator.java:
	added wrapper-getter&setter for trainingFlag
	
org.tb.web.form.AddSuborderForm.java:
	added a new variable Boolean trainingFlag with getter and setter and default-value false (in reset).
	
addSuborder.jsp:
	added a checkbox for setting the new variable.
	
showSuborder.jsp:
	added a tr for the new variable in the info-mouseover-table 

org.tb.web.action.admin.StoreSuborderAction.java:
	l. 307: copy value of variable from form into suborder before saving.

org.tb.web.action.admin.EditSuborderAction.java:
	l. 89: set the value of the trainingFlag of the suborder to be edited into the form.
	
org.tb.web.action.StoreDailyReportAction.java:
	ll 368ff: added logic so that default-flag for training in suborder results in pre-checked training box in new timereport
	
	
Tests:
- Created new Suborder with Default-Flag on (as admin)
		 - new timereport (as sql): After choosing the new suborder, the training flag is automatically set on. On saving the timereport, training is saved as True.
		 	Flag can be manually set off-> Saving: training is saved as False. 
		 - Editing a timereport with this suborder: training flag can be manually set on and off as before, saving works as before.
- edit existing suborder: Default-Flag on
		 - test with new timereport / editing a timereport: as above
- editing existing suborder: Default-Tag switched from on to off
		- new timereport: training flag is not automatically set on, manually setting it on and off works as before.
